# Petals basic

This package is the foundation of UI development, it includes:

- CSS base styles for web apps (based on [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) and [SUIT CSS base](https://github.com/suitcss/base))
- CSS utilities (based on [SUIT CSS utilities](https://github.com/suitcss/utils))
- Sass variables, functions and mixins (based on [Trick](https://github.com/ourai/trick))

I think you need to read more about [Petals](https://github.com/ourai/petals). ;-)
